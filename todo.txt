- Fix the issue with cuting files from folders opend by litestep
	* Unless explorer is called explicitly with LSUseSystemDDE this bug will occur.
	* Hijacking clicks and calling ShellExecute() could fix this.
		* (group)ExplicitCalls does just this.
- Fix the bug which causes .zip files to be inert on XP
	* Deleting (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SystemFileAssociations\.zip) will fix it (no idea what it does).
	* Possibly something related to the whole viewing zip files as folders thing.
- Fix the bug which causes the My Documents folder to be inert on XP
	* Changing Attributes in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{450D8FBA-AD25-11D0-98A8-0800361B1103}\ShellFolder from
	   F080013D to B080013D will fix it (Removing SFGAO_HASPROPSHEET).
	* (group)ExplicitCalls will at least let it open, even if the right click menu doesn't work
- Delete the clipboard data once a file is cut away from clickonic
	* Explorer doesn't delete it on it's own, it's supposed to send a message but it doesn't.
- Add support for ctrl+z
	* No API function, but maybe you could abuse the system menu.
- Add .back/.forward to changedir
- Add support for custom file managers
	- Replace (group)ExplicitCalls with this?
- Add .last(saved folder location) to (group)Folder
- Add vista/windows7 support
	- Icons are forcibly auto arranged on startup?
		* It's possible to position them correctly using !RestoreIconPositions after the group has loaded.
		* It seems to be imposibole to set the position of an icon when it's first added to the group
- Improve on drag&drop support
	- Add right click drag&drop menu
	- Improve on icon positioning after external drops
- Add an AddToGroup setting
- Add *(Group)Hide "iconname" setting?
- Use ListView_InsertItem instead of refreshing the folder when Toggling an icon into visibility.
- Specify a custom icon size and change it dynamically
	* Clickonic uses the global system icon size right now.
	* This setting is only reloaded after restarting litestep (!quit).
- Ability to paste pictures from the clipboard
	+ Add (group)DontPastePictures
	- Add (group)PicturePasteFormat setting
- Ability to paste audio from the clipboard
	+ Add (group)DontPasteAudio
	- Add (group)AudioPasteFormat
- Get the system menu to show "properties", at least for the desktop
- Add (group)TextPasteFormat setting
- Stop system menus from reseting icon positions
- Keep group variables updated when they are changed through the system menu
	* Explorer never clears styles with LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE
- Make the code compilable with unicode?
	* TCHARS & explicit A/W function calls
- Handle large changes in icon spacing better?
- Check into icon positioning with grids turned of
- Improve on CGroup::CopyFiles
	- Provide more clipboard formats?
	- Toggle DROPFILES.fWide depending on os?
- Fix possible crash related to shell extensions when right clicking an icon
	* Unable to confirm shell extensions as the cause
- Decide on /MT or /MD
	* /MD is about half the size of /MT and will use updated .dll files
	* /MD promotes installiation of the VC runtimes
	* /MT avoids runtime issues and lets people who don't have the necesary rights to install runtimes use clickonic
	* Currently, /MT is used
